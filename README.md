# S-15 Code Repository

This repository carries the code for the main project: Doodloo, an online application that allows children to transfer their hand-drawn images and toys to a digital screen and interact with them there. 

For details on the other 3 projects, please refer to:
- History (a geo-location + photo-site mashup)
- The Umm-counter (speech recognition for fillers)
- Logo-bot (a modern, cheap rendition of Dr. Seymour Papert's tool for teaching children Mathematics and programming)
