				<h2>The Main Character: Tis Mar Khan</h2>
                <img src="img/margallas-300.jpg" alt="The Margalla Hills" class="">
                <p>Muhammad Khan, a poor village tailor from Saidpur journeys through pre-mutiny India in search of his cousin. His encounters with friends and foes along the way seal his reputation as Tis Mar Khan (The chief who defeats 30 at a time). His adventures become known far and wide before he is thrown into the midst of the Indian mutiny against the British East India Company. His character is put to test before he proves himself worthy of the title.</p>
