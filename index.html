	<h1>Project Working Title: Doodloo</h1>

<h2>Target Audience: </h2>
<p>
<b>Primary Audience:</b> Children between the ages of 3 and 8<br>
<b>Secondary Audience:</b> Older children and possibly also adults
</p>

<h2>What does the audience value or appreciate?</h2>
<p>
Children like playful experiences. We are hoping to create enjoyable ‘play’ by allowing children to draw objects on paper and animate them on a screen.  
</p>

<h2>How would you be able to tell whether your project was successful (for the audience)?</h2>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>If children between the ages of 3 and 8 spend a lot of time (undefined?) on the application and ask for repeat access, it will indicate that they enjoyed it. </li>
		<li>If we observe children using the application for behaviors beyond those demonstrated to them, it will indicate a willingness to explore its limits. </li>
		<li>If we observe children talking about their experience in real-life terms (e.g. motion in earth vs space), it will indicate a transfer of learning. </li>
	</ol>
</p>
<h2>What would differentiate a high-quality from a low-quality (but "successful") version of your project?</h2>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>Completeness (how many milestones we are able to complete)</li>
		<li>Comprehensiveness (which features of the project we are able to implement successfully)</li>
		<li>Conjurorship (how much it surprises those playing it for the first time)</li>
	</ol>
